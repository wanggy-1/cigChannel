See our ESSD paper for details:  
[cigChannel: a large-scale 3D seismic dataset with labeled paleochannels for advancing deep learning in seismic interpretation](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-17-3447-2025)

The cigChannel dataset, containing 1600 seismic volumes, is available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10791151)
